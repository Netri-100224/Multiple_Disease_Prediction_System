# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System
This repository contains four disease prediction systems which are collaborated together to create a streamlit web app  that predicts if a person is healthy or not based on medical reports data.

## If someone is unable to access zip files,they can go to another branch i.e.Disease_models.This branch contains all models in ipynb files and dataset in csv files.
